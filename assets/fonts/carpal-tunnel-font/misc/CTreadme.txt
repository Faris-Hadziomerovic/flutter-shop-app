This font is distributed as-is, and has no warranties on it whatsoever, except that I am fairly sury it's virus-free and know that it works.

It is the scanned-in product of my father's old manual typewriter, whose stiff green keys must be solidly whacked to produce the optimal effect (a legible page).  Many of the characters this font has are not to be found on that typewriter, such as the exotic vowels, or the numeral 1.  However, those which are included were produced on the typewriter, mainly, and not by chasing contours in the font itself.  They are, therefore, "legitimate" characters from that typewriter.

Distribute this disclaimer with the font at all times.  If you include it in a disc/CD collection, leave this .ZIP file separate and intact.  All modified versions need an editor's signature in the credits of the font file itself.  Thank you.

Enjoy!
