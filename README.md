# Flutter Shop App

A new Flutter eCommerce sort of project.

This is the first and main screen showing an overview of products and some actions that can be performed like pull to refresh, favourite and add to cart.
On the second image we can see the globally-available side-menu used for navigating through the following screens.

This is the same screen just in landscape mode.

Here are the user's own products, options to add new and edit / delete existing ones. 
On the second screen you can see the edit product screen with some field validations and image previews.

This is the My Cart screen shown when it's empty.

At the end of the flow we have the already ordered items and just their preview. 
We can't do anything about them, they are already paid for, we can just expand and minimize.
